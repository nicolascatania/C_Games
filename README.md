# Games in C!

## Tic Tac Toe

Simple offline game of tic tac toe running in cmd.

## Hangman Game

This program uses a .txt file to get some words that you can write there (Only UPPERCASE and with no spaces in bettewen).
The main idea is allocating all the words in the .txt file in memory, so the program does not makes more than 1 access to this file, making it slow.

If you manage to guess the word, you win, but you have only three lifes (each error costs you one life), when it reaches zero, you loose. 
No matter what happens, you can choose to keep playing or exit.

The word is randomly choosen.
